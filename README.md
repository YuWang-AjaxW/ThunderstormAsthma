Project Title : Thunderstorm Asthma

Motivation: We are a team of professionals who intend to help all those who are aged or infants and are most likely to be affected by such weather conditions. Since Asthma affects all age groups, however, younger (5-15) and older (65+) people, in particular, are more likely to be impacted. An asthma reaction could cause severe symptoms which may require medical care. Severity can vary from mild to life-threatening depending on the lifestyle as well as the genetics of the individual. Individuals that are smoking, lacking physical activity and weight are major risk factors. Our mission is to be spread awareness and reach out to these groups of people so that we can save lives during such freak epidemics. We as a team have taken it a s responsibility to make sure that such circumstances are avoided.
